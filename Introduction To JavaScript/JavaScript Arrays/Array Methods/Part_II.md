# Part I! of Array Methods

4. Try to explain, in your own words (or diagrams!) what the difference is between passing by value vs. passing by reference.
   - Pass by value makes a copy of a parameter's value, in other words, the actual value of a parameter is passed. Changes made to the copied array will not affect the value of the original parameter while Pass by reference makes a copy or passes the address of a parameter in memory. Changes made to the value of the copied array will be affect the value of the intial parameter
